# Implementation of the LexRank method for text summarization

LexRank is an extractive text summarization technique that works through graph-based clustering where the importance of the sentences is calculated through the concept of eigenvector centrality in the sentence graph.

## Running the code

Running this one is as simple as copying the folder into your Google Drive, updating the paths on the given Colab Notebook (the path containing `Corpus_TXT_PFC2` refers to the folder containing the base documents), and running `Runtime->Run all`. The results will be available on the `Sumarios_PFC2` subfolder.
